        be able to develop and test Gaphical User Interfaces on your PC, using 
        our popular debugging tool: µC/GUI-View.<br>
        At the same time, With the addition of a bitmap representing your target 
        system, you will be able to use our GUI Simulator to build prototypes 
        of your application and demonstrate your application to your customers. 
      <P class="FAT-title-black">The use of a special LCD Display driver designed for 
  the PC allows your application to run exactly as on your target system. All 
  the code developed for your simulation can be reused for your taget application 
  by only replacing the LCD Driver.
